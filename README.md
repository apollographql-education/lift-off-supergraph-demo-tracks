# Odyssey Lift-off X tracks

This is the starting point Tracks "classic graph" from lift-off V, that we turned into a subgraph to expand the catstronaut's supergraph, starting with the [users subgraph](https://github.com/apollographql-education/lift-off-x-demo-users-final) for the license feature.

Run this subgraph first with `rover dev` then the users subgraph.

## Running the subgraph

With rover dev:
```bash
rover dev --command "npm run dev" --schema "src/schema.graphql" 
```
