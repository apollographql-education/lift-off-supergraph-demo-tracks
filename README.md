# Odyssey Lift-off: Destination Supergraph - tracks

This is the starting point for Odyssey Lift-off: Destination Supergraph! You can find the [course lessons and instructions on Odyssey](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-supergraph/), Apollo's learning platform.

We'll be turning this GraphQL server into a subgraph to expand the Catstronaut's supergraph, along with the [users subgraph](https://github.com/apollographql-education/lift-off-supergraph-demo-users).

## Running this server

1. In a terminal window, install the packages.

    ```
    npm install
    ```

1. Then, run the server.

    ```
    npm start
    ```

This will start the GraphQL server on `localhost:4001`, where you can use Apollo Sandbox to run queries.

[Follow the course instructions](https://www.apollographql.com/tutorials/lift-off-supergraph/) to turn this server into a subgraph.
